Hours to complete assignment (optional): 30 min



/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe your artistic creation, and how you went about writing   
 *  a program to produce it. If you found information about a
 *  fractal from somewhere (like our book, the booksite, or
 *  another offline or online source) mention it here. 
 *  (Note that you must not have used *code* from sources other than the
 *  book/booksite, and even such code should be cited in the program.)
 **********************************************************************/
My art is a square pattern design that draws 8 squares in the n,ne,e,se, 
s,sw,w, and nw directions with a 1/3 of the length of previous square 
length. Also, every new set of squares changes color. I recursively call
the repeat method to draw the 8 new square until n order is reached.


/**********************************************************************

 *  anyone else?  Please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA" or
