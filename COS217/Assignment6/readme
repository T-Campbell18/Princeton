Challenge part: Answer the following questions in detail

- Why does ./testbuzzlistmin < 06file0.txt use 16 Bytes of memory?


- Why does ./testbuzzhashmin < 06file0.txt use 4096 Bytes of memory?

- Why does ./testbuzzlistpad < 06file0.txt use the same memory as the
./testbuzzhashpad < 06file0.txt?

- Which of the ./testbuzzSlist2 and ./testbuzzShash2 is faster? Why?
./testbuzzShash2
