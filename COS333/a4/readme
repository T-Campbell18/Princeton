new Web.java program, as well as the other java files.

Tyler: 
Created the all the java files. First the classes to reprsent a course and a class. Then
using the Spark framework create the html code. Then using the vtl files from Joel linked the 2
modifyng the files as needed. Then worked on handling errors and fixing bugs with the code. I spent 
around 3 hours on the assignment to start and an addtional 1 to fix bugs. This assignment was very
helpful as having no prior experience with back end development. The understanding of spark framework
will help with my project as well.
