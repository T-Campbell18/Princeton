          |      Work     |     Span
  --------------------------------------
  tabulate|       O(n)    |     O(1)
  map     |       O(n)    |     O(1)
  reduce  |       O(n)    |     O(log n)

  Assumptions:

Assume for map that it is applied to a function f 
that is a O(1) work and span function. For reduce,
assume c is a O(1) work and span function if reduce
is applied as: "reduce c b s".
